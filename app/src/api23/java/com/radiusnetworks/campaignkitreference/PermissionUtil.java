     * android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION}. Additionally,
     * Google Play Service needs access to {@link

     * triggering.
     * <p/>
     * Since the permissions we need are critical. We ask upfront. As this is a sample app it
     * may, or may not, be clear why we need the permissions. Since this is only a reference we
     * are no providing any on boarding and defer the explanation until necessary.
